# XS_mat
X-ray near-field speckle-based phase sensing routines - Matlab (old) scripts

Author: Sebastien Berujon

These are a collection of script that I developed and sometimes used for the processing of XST / XSVT / XSS / ... datas. 
See references below for details and referencing.



These codes date from both my time at DLS and the ESRF.
